# Scripts

This directory contains the 2 scripts used for the analysis. In order to simplify the scripts and in turn to speed analysis time, the scripts are seperated into 2 tasks

    * Create a database of only apks with BLE Permissions
    * Analyze Bluetooth APK for labelling.
        * See the `Labels` directory for a full list of the labels we look for.
